# Personal-Blog-Website--Udacity
Project of the Nanodegree Course 'Front End Web Development'.
## Details

### Content
#### HTML
The blog has 3 HTML pages:
- Home page (index.html);
- About page (I put the README file haha);
- Sample blog post page.

#### CSS
I used 1 main file (style.css) and imported other 3 files with the changes for media versions (mobile, tablet and desktop). On the main CSS file is the code that is the same for every page.

#### Java Script
I have not used JS in this website because of the purpose of the project.

### Responsiveness
I used the `viewport` meta tag - [More information here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag);

Aaand the `@media` queries - [More information here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp).

## Contribution
Since I am learning Front end Web Development, any tips or suggestions are greatly appreciated.
