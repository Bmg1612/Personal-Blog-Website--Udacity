# Personal-Blog-Website--Udacity
Project of the Nanodegree Course 'Front End Web Development'.
## Details

### Content
The blog has 3 HTML pages:
- Home page (index.html);
- About page (I put the README file haha);
- Sample blog post page

And 1 css file that I used Grid (page) and Flexbox (content):
- style.css

I have not used JS in this website because of the purpose of the project

### Responsiveness
I used the `viewport` meta tag - [More information here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Mobile/Viewport_meta_tag);

Aaand the `@media` queries - [More information here](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp).

## Contribution
